;;;; Lem (https://github.com/lem-project/lem) on Clysm, with a frontend
;;;; written with Clysm's UI framework (ui/): the editor runs in the page of
;;;; a desktop application (Electron), and its windows are elements of the
;;;; page.  See README.md here; contrib/lem/build.sh builds the application.
;;;;
;;;; The image that loads it contains the UI framework (build.sh builds it).
