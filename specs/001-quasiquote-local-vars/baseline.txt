# Quasiquote Local Variable Compilation - Baseline Measurement
# Date: 2026-01-01
# Task: T001

## Baseline Error Count

Command: sbcl --load build/stage1-complete.lisp 2>&1 | grep -c "Cannot compile quoted"
Result: 0

## Notes

- No "Cannot compile quoted element" errors detected in Stage 1 generation
- Previous P464 (QUASIQUOTE) error pattern work may have partially addressed this
- The specific local variable patterns may not be exercised in current Stage 1 source
- This baseline will be compared to post-implementation count in T049/T051

## Stage 1 Compilation Status

- Compilation completes without quasiquote-related errors
- Feature implementation will add test coverage for previously untested patterns
